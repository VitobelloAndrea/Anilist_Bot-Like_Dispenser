# Anilist_Bot-Like_Dispenser

# TODO
- deal with failed requests (pages: send the same request again; like: wait for a minute, then restart where you stopped): ***DONE***
- add a check on the number of requests remaining for the current minute (useless as of now, but the API might change over time)
- add a mode for the global list
- add a mode to target a specific user
- get everything inside a single exe because it comes a lot easier, and set it up so that it asks for the credentials at the start and that's it, the app is tuned
